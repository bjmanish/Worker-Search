# Local Workers Search Application (Using Java)

# 1. Introduction:
  The Local Workers Search Application is designed to connect clients with local skilled workers, such as electricians, plumbers, and carpenters.
  This platform allows users to search, communicate, and hire workers for specific tasks. The project focuses on providing a reliable, scalable,
  and secure platform without using any Spring-related frameworks. An Admin Module is included for managing the platform.

# 2. Objective:
  The objective of this project is to build a Java-based platform that helps users search for local workers, book them, and make payments
  seamlessly. The application will focus on a simplified user experience and secure functionality, relying on core Java technologies rather than
  frameworks like Spring.

# 3. Features of the Application:
- User Registration & Profiles: Separate user types for workers and clients with profile management.
- Search & Filter: Users can search workers by skill, location, availability, and customer ratings.
- Booking System: A mechanism for clients to book workers for specific tasks or projects.
- Review & Rating: Clients can review and rate workers.
- In-App Messaging: Real-time communication for discussing task details and negotiating terms.
- Payment Integration: Secure payment system for handling payments through the app.
- Notifications: SMS and email notifications to keep users updated about bookings and other events.

# 4. Admin Module:

Key Features of the Admin Module:
- User Management: Admins can manage clients and workers, verify worker profiles, and edit or suspend accounts.
- Booking & Service Management: Admins can monitor, approve, or reject bookings and resolve disputes between clients and workers.
- Worker Approval and Verification: Admins can verify new worker profiles before allowing them to be visible on the platform.
- Platform Monitoring: Track platform usage, such as the number of bookings, users, and worker ratings.
- Payment Monitoring: Monitor payment transactions and manage refunds.
- Content Management: Manage content such as FAQs, Terms & Conditions, and platform announcements.
- Notifications & Announcements: Send bulk notifications or updates to users.
- Reports and Analytics: Generate reports on user activity, bookings, and platform performance.

# 5. Technology Stack:

Frontend (Web Interface):
- HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript: For creating the user interface and ensuring responsiveness across devices.
- JavaScript Frameworks (React.js / Angular / Vue.js): For building interactive front-end components for an intuitive user experience.
- Ajax & REST APIs: For asynchronous communication between the front-end and back-end, allowing real-time updates without page reloads.

Backend (Java Technologies):
- Java Servlets: Core Java technology used for handling client requests and responses.
- JSP (JavaServer Pages): For creating dynamic web pages on the server side and integrating front-end with Java back-end logic.
- Servlet API: To handle HTTP requests and manage session-based interactions between users and the server.

Database:
- MySQL / PostgreSQL: Relational database management systems for storing user information, worker profiles, bookings, and reviews.
- JDBC (Java Database Connectivity): For directly interacting with the relational database using SQL queries to perform CRUD operations.
- Hibernate ORM (Optional): If required, for mapping Java objects to relational database tables and simplifying database access (though this is outside Spring).

Security:
- Custom Security Implementation: Instead of using Spring Security, a custom security solution can be implemented.
  - Authentication & Authorization: Managed using session-based authentication or token-based authentication (such as JWT).
  - Password Encryption: Using libraries like Bcrypt or Java’s built-in cryptography libraries for secure password storage.
  - Role-based Access Control: Implement custom access control by defining roles such as “Worker” and “Client”.

# 6. System Architecture:

Client-Side:
- User interface built with React.js or Angular to allow interactive and responsive design for users and administrators.

Server-Side:
- Backend Java Servlets handle business logic, with separate modules for clients, workers, and administrators.

Security Layer:
- Role-based access control ensures admin privileges are distinct from worker and client privileges.

# 7. Target Users:
- Clients looking to hire skilled workers.
- Local skilled workers looking for job opportunities.
- Admins managing platform users and services.

# 8. Benefits:
- For Admins: Complete control over user management, worker approvals, and platform security.
- For Clients and Workers: A reliable, well-managed platform with verified workers and fair dispute resolution processes.

# 9. Conclusion:
The Local Workers Search Application, built using Java technologies without relying on Spring, offers a robust and scalable platform
with a comprehensive Admin Module for managing users, bookings, and payments.
